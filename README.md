## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone and Install**:

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Upload Log Files
1. Navigate to the **LogMerger** page
2. Use the drag-and-drop zone or file browser to upload one or more log files
3. Supported formats: `.log`, `.txt` files
4. View uploaded files in the file list with size and status information

### Step 2: Configure Grouping Patterns
1. **Built-in Patterns**:
   - **Log Level**: Groups by ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG levels
   - **Hour-based**: Groups entries by hour timestamps
   - **Custom Pattern**: Define your own regex pattern

2. **Pattern Examples**:
   - Error logs: `\[ERROR\]|ERROR:|Exception`
   - Database queries: `SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE`
   - User activities: `login|logout|authentication`

### Step 3: Process and View Results
1. Click "Process Files" to merge and analyze log content
2. View real-time statistics: files, total lines, filtered lines, groups
3. Use search to filter across all merged content
4. Expand/collapse groups as needed for focused analysis

### Step 4: Navigate with Pagination
1. **Set Items Per Page**: Choose your preferred page size from the dropdown
2. **Navigate Pages**: Use Previous/Next buttons or click specific page numbers
3. **View Entry Ranges**: See exactly which entries are currently displayed
4. **Group-Specific Navigation**: Each group maintains independent pagination

### Step 5: Export Results
1. Click "Export Results" to download grouped content
2. Exports include group information, entry counts, and full log data
3. JSON format with structured group and entry data
